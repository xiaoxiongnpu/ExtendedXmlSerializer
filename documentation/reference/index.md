# ExtendedXmlSerializer API Reference

Welcome to the API Reference documentation.  Here you will find all documented classes from code defined within the ExtendedXmlSerializer project.

Start by visiting a topic within the Table of Contents.

If you are unsure of a topic to start with, we recommend visiting the `ConfigurationContainer` ([link](/reference/ExtendedXmlSerializer.Configuration.ConfigurationContainer.html)) as that is where all the fun starts. üëç
